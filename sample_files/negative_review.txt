Customer Service Review - Online Shopping Experience

I recently purchased a laptop from TechStore Online and I must say, I am thoroughly disappointed with the entire experience. The product arrived two weeks late, despite paying for express shipping. When it finally arrived, the packaging was damaged and the laptop had visible scratches on the cover.

I contacted customer service immediately, but getting a response took three days. When someone finally replied, they were unhelpful and dismissive of my concerns. They claimed the scratches were "normal wear and tear" even though the product was supposed to be brand new.

After multiple follow-ups and escalations, they agreed to send a replacement, but the process took another two weeks. The replacement had different issues - the battery life was significantly shorter than advertised and the keyboard had a stuck key.

I requested a full refund, which was initially denied. Only after threatening legal action did they agree to process the refund, which took an additional 10 business days to appear in my account.

This has been the worst online shopping experience I've ever had. I will never purchase from TechStore Online again and I strongly advise others to avoid this company. Their quality control is non-existent and their customer service is absolutely terrible.
